An instant chat app where all contacts are bots.

This is a client for the openAI api, so you need an API key.  
You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

This is running entirely on your browser. The only network calls are the ones for the openAi API.  

## Features (or why this is different from just using ChatGPT)

- Conversations are stored on your browser.  
- With one sentence you can create any character, including an avatar
- The prompt has a plan phase where you can inspect why the character responded in a certain way.
- Language models work better when they plan the answer beforehand
- With the character profiles the conversation is more focused.  
- Because the character has a profile, you can create character with different opinions.  
- You can create group chats with characters with different opinions and learn from them.
- It is fun
