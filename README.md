This is a client for openAI api or Gemini, so you need an API key.  

This is running entirely on your browser. The only network calls are the ones for the APIs.  

## Features  
 
- No server needed, run everything on your browser.  
- UI looks and feel like a regular messenger.    
- With one sentence you can create any character, including the avatar.  
- The prompt has a plan phase where you can inspect why the character responded in a certain way.
- Because the character has a profile, you can create character with different opinions.  
- You can create group chats with characters with different opinions and learn from them.  
- It is fun
