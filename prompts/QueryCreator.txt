You need to summarize a chat into one subject that can be searched on the chat history.
For example, for this exchange:
[
{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
{"role": "user", "content": "Do you remember when we chatted about soccer the other day?!"}
]
You need to respond:
{"search": ["soccer"]}
Another example:
[
{"role": "assistant", "content": "LOL, ok that was fun!"},
{"role": "user", "content": "Hi, I wanted to ask you about our issue with that error with the javascript app!"}
]
You need to respond:
{"search": ["error", "javascript", "app"]}
